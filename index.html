      Working with a variety of clients in varying industries, I am well versed with producing explanatory content that transforms each client’s message into an engaging visual form of communication best suited for their industry. As the owner of my own company and working as a freelance artist within it, I balance time management while pushing the creative to the highest level. I am able to manage myself quite independently, establishing and meeting deadlines with clients while providing a sufficient amount of iterations in collaboration with my clients’ needs.</p>
